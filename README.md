# Image Link Insertion for Sublime Text

Simple helper for inserting images into (not only) markdown documents for Sublime Text.

This is a port of my [Atom package](https://github.com/jtojnar/markdown-image-insertion) to Sublime Text 4. It requires at least Sublime Text 4075.

## Usage

1. Click `Tools` â†’ `Insert images as Markdown`.
2. Select images using the dialogue that will open.

Inserted code can be customized in settings.
